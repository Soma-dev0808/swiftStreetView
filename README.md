## Why created this app

This app was mainly created to show my skill in mobile development, and acquire great opportunity to work in iOS development industry.

I've been working as web developer for 1yr anf half, and as mobile developer for half year. After some of experience with mobile development, I noticed that I'm more interested in mobile, therefore decided to focus working on it especially Swift. 

This app was developed after watching of some tutorials to have fundamental skills for Swift. 

The duration of developing this application is 1 week(7 hrs of work per day)
